# ALTTP-Boss-Tracker
Java based Boss Tracker for use on streams.

If you enjoy this Tracker, consider giving me a follow on https://www.twitch.tv/pastillage


## Features
* Toggleable decals on top of boss images.
* Fast prize selection thanks to SHIFT or CTRL clicking.
* Amount of chests customization.
* Fully remapable boss location.
* And more!

## Why make this?
I was unsatisfied with current Trackers because I couldn't remap the bosses into a straight column for use on my stream, in order to do this initally I literally cropped several images and put them on my stream, however, this resulted in an aproximately 20fps stream, with this additional tracker I aim to remove the bottleneck caused by all that cropping by having a program that will have the proper placement for me by default.
